## SVAI Hackathon June 2017
Codes for the main analysis steps in our project are listed here. 
* VCF Filter: [VCF_filtering.ipynb](VCF_filtering.ipynb)
* TCGA Data: [Broad FireHose Dat\.ipynb](Broad%20FireHose%20Data.ipynb)
* Mutational Signature Extraction: [tcga_processing.R](tcga_processing.R)
* Dimensional reduction and Cluster Analysis:	[Cluster Analysis.ipynb](Cluster%20Analysis.ipynb)
* Gene Mutation Localization: [NF2 VCF Analysis.ipynb](NF2%20VCF%20Analysis.ipynb)

Details of our analysis can before found in our [poster](HackPoster.pdf) and [final presentation](C3finalpresentation.pdf)
