# C3 (aka c-cubed)
* Cancer Clustering Collaborative - Inferring NF2 Treatment Based on Similarity to characterized cancers
* Details of our analysis can before found in our [poster](HackPoster.pdf) and [final presentation](C3finalpresentation.pdf)

## SVAI Hackathon June 2017
Codes for the main analysis steps in our project are listed here. 
* VCF Filter: [VCF_filtering.ipynb](VCF_filtering.ipynb)
* TCGA Data Loading/Processing: [Broad FireHose Dat\.ipynb](Broad%20FireHose%20Data.ipynb)
* Mutational Signature and mutated gene/GO term Extraction, preparing matrices for clustering: [tcga_processing.R](tcga_processing.R)
